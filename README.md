* Development Journal !!!
    * What game controller is this patch developed for?
        * PlayStation 3 Controller
    * Regarding the interactions that you created:
        * What kind of control is expected from interacting with each button and with the motion sensors?
            * Control of pitch
        * What kind of interpolation did you use for each parameter and what others did you try?
            * There are a variety of effects on the sounds to create a dense ambient atmosphere. 
    * What went well?
        * Using a button to control one pitch was simple, but I would like to try giving more variety of controls on my instrument
    * What did you try that didnâ€™t work?
        * It mainly just took me a while and a variety of trial and error to figure out how to send messages from the gamepad object, but once I figured that out, things became pretty straight forward.
        * I would like to learn how to setup my patch so that the pitches, velocities, and amount of effects are already set up.
        * Also, the notes will trigger randomly sometimes without me hitting that button, which works for ambient music, but I would like to learn how to prevent this for next time. 
* User Manual
    * Initialization instructions: What are the steps to get setup with your patch?

    * Usage instructions: How do you intend your instrument to be played?
        * In an ambient music. Setting, or to help set the tone for a variety of other musical, or non-musical situations.
